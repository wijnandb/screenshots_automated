# screenshots_automated
Application to automatically check sites page by page, login if needed and take screenshots.

See https://chat.openai.com/c/49651583-b6a1-464d-929c-ba85c52af4b7 for the GPT-4 chat with questions and answers.

Summary:
- visit site
- login with certain role
- visit all pages belonging to that role
- take screenshots
- record role, URL, time of visit, statuscode, screenshot

We can use this to test a site completely, use it for further development.

Results are shared on a webpage, so people at client can access them and use them for suggestions for improvement.

Also usable to onboard new clients, to give them an idea of what the application doies and looks like, and give them the option to propose changes/a different walk-through.

Another way of using it is to check if there are any errors on the site. If a 404, 403, 500 comes back, escalate.
